                My programming journey began in <span className='text-indigo-500 text-2xl'> 2017 </span>, when I started studying <span className='text-indigo-500 text-2xl'> Computer Engineering </span> in Colombia. After two years of study, life circumstances required me to pause my education and relocate to the United States.

                In 2022, I decided to continue the path I had started by returning to school. I enrolled at <span className='text-indigo-500 text-2xl'> St. Petersburg College</span>, where I graduated with a degree in <span className='text-indigo-500 text-2xl'> Computer & Information Science.</span> I also completed the required coursework to transfer to the <span className='text-indigo-500 text-2xl'>University of South Florida</span>, where I am currently pursuing a <span className='text-indigo-500 text-2xl'>Computer Science </span> degree.

                These experiences strengthened my resilience and reinforced my commitment to building a career in software development through continuous learning and hands-on projects.
